	<h2>Annalise Keating</h2>
	<!--<h4>Do you have a scandal you need handled? Are you wondering how to get away with murder? Olivia Pope & Annelise Keating have got you covered. </h4> -->
	<p>Annalise is a law professor at Middleton University and runs a pro-bono law clinic. She is stubborn, fierce, and knows how to get what she wants. Even when things seem to be going against her, she is probably already 3 steps ahead and ready to come out on top. She can make even the biggest messes disappear... </p>
