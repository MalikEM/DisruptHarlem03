<h2>
One - "My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
My heart leaps up when I behold
<br>
A rainbow in the sky:
<br>
So was it when my life began,
<br>
So is it now I am a man,
<br>
So be it when I shall grow old
<br>
Or let me die!
<br>
The Child is father of the Man:
<br>
And I could wish my days to be
<br>
Bound each to each by natural piety.

<h2>
Two - Sonnets from the Portuguese 43
"How do I Love thee? Let me Count the Ways" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
<br>
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
<br>
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
<br>
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
<br>
I love thee to the level of every day's
<br>
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
<br>
I love thee freely, as men strive for right;
<br>
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
<br>
I love thee with the passion put to use
<br>
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
<br>
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
<br>
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
<br>
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
<br>
I shall but love thee better after death.

<h2>
Three - "When You Are Old" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
<br>
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
<br>
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
<br>
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
</p>
<p>
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
<br>
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
<br>
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
<br>
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
</p>
<p>
And bending down beside the glowing bars,
<br>
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
<br>
And paced upon the mountains overhead
<br>
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

<h2>
Four - "Sympathy" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
<br>
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
<br>   
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass, 
<br>  
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
<br>
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,   
<br>
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals—
<br>
I know what the caged bird feels!
</p>
<p>
I know why the caged bird beats his wing
<br>
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;   
<br>
For he must fly back to his perch and cling   
<br>
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
<br>
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars   
<br>
And they pulse again with a keener sting—
<br>
I know why he beats his wing!
</p>
<p>
I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
<br>
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,—
<br>
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
<br>
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
<br>
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,   
<br>
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings—
<br>
I know why the caged bird sings!

<h2>
Five - "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
I wandered lonely as a cloud
<br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,
<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;
<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
</p>
<p>
Continuous as the stars that shine
<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,
<br>
They stretched in never-ending line
<br>
Along the margin of a bay:
<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
</p>
<p>
The waves beside them danced; but they
<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
<br>
A poet could not but be gay,
<br>
In such a jocund company:
<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:
</p>
<p>
For oft, when on my couch I lie
<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,
<br>
They flash upon that inward eye
<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;
<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
<br>
And dances with the daffodils.

<h2>
Six - "To My Dear and Loving Husband" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
If ever two were one, then surely we.
<br>
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
<br>
If ever wife was happy in a man,
<br>
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
<br>
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
<br>
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
<br>
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
<br>
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
<br>
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
<br>
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
<br>
Then while we live, in love let's so persever,
<br>
That when we live no more, we may live ever.

<h2>
Seven - "When I have Fears That I May Cease to Be" - Posted 11/28/2016
</h2>

<p>
When I have fears that I may cease to be
<br>
Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
<br>
Before high-pilèd books, in charactery,
<br>
Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;
<br>
When I behold, upon the night's starred face,
<br>
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
<br>
And think that I may never live to trace
<br>
Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;
<br>
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
<br>
That I shall never look upon thee more,
<br>
Never have relish in the fairy power
<br>
Of unreflecting love—then on the shore
<br>
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
<br>
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.
</p>
