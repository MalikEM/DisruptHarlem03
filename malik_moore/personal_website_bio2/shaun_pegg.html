 <p>Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, is a character of the 2004 horror-comedy film Shaun of the Dead. Shaun is a 30-something slacker who works at a electronics store, while living with his best friend, Ed (Nick Frost), in a small flat on the outskirts of London. When the dead begin to walk and overrun their town, he fights through the dead to save his more or less girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) and his mom Barbara (Penelope Wilton). Shaun must rise to the occasion for the first time in his life to save his friends and family.</p>
