 <p>Richard "Rick" Grimes is the protagonist of Image Comics The Walking Dead. Rick has been described as an everyman who emphasizes moral codes and values. Once a former police deputy from Cynthiana, Kentucky, he awakens from a coma to find the world infested with zombies. He reunits with his wife, Lori, and son, Carl, and encounters many survivors along the way. He gradually becomes the de facto leader of a group, while dealing with many leadership struggles. His leadership qualities and experience eventually leads him to become the leader of a much larger community while continuing to deal with many threats, human and dead, that cost the lives of many. Over the course of the comic book series, he faces sheer brutality in order to protect his fellow group members and later community from harm.</p>
