 <h2>Welcome</h2>
 <p>This website contains two site pages of one movie character (Shaun from Shaun of the Dead) and one comic book character (Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead). The film Shaun of the Dead was released in 2004 while The Walking Dead began in 2003 with it's first issue. Both characters were created in mind to be the ideal "everyday man" to connect with anyone and everyone. Although both are very different in their approach to the new world they live in, they are forced to lead in difficult situations to protect their friends and family or lose them all.</p>
