	<h2>Annalise Keating</h2>
	<!--<h4>Do you have a scandal you need handled? Are you wondering how to get away with murder? Olivia Pope & Annelise Keating have got you covered. </h4> -->
	<p>Annalise is a law professor at Middleton University and runs a pro-bono law clinic. She is stubborn, fierce, and knows how to get what she wants. Helping her clients is always her first priority. Even when things seem to be going against her, she is already 3 steps ahead of the game and ready to come out on top. She can make even the biggest messes disappear... </p>
