	<h2>My name is Camera and this is my webpage!</h2>
	<p>I'm a geologist from Harlem who loves writing, languages, and learning new things. My favorite part of geology is studying volcanoes. I also like seeing new places and meeting new people.</p>

	<p>I'm excited to learn basic programming skills with the #CodeSquad so that I can learn more programming languages in the future!</p>
